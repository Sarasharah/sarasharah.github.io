  <h1>All about Sarah Klein</h1>

  <p>I'm born and raised in New York City. Although, my heart will always belong there, I have no regrets moving away.
    In fact, I believe moving to Charlotte is in the top 3 best choices I've made fore myself in my life.
  </p>

  <p>I love real estate and following trends of where people move to and what they are looking for in a home.
    But I would never be an agent! I just love the analytics of it and mapping out trends.
  </p>

  <p>I'm not a fan of social media. But here's a link to my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/safrakle/">Instagram</a> if you want to be nosy.</p>
